## Disclaimers

1. This is a personal project and does not represent or reflect the views, opinions, or work of my current employer, Aquia, or any previous employers.

2. The code, configurations, and resources in this repository are for **educational purposes only**. While they demonstrate security concepts, they should not be used directly in production environments without proper review, testing, and customization for your specific security and compliance requirements.

## Project Vision

This GRC Portfolio Hub is my initiative to showcase hands-on Governance, Risk, and Compliance projects, blending technical security practices with compliance frameworks. My goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical execution by documenting labs, case studies, and simulations that demonstrate real-world GRC engineering.

The purpose of this portfolio is twofold:
1. To provide a clear demonstration of my skills in GRC, risk management, and cloud security.
2. To create a living resource that highlights my approach to aligning business risk with technical security controls.

This hub reflects my belief that effective cybersecurity comes from not just knowing frameworks, but applying them in practical, measurable ways.

## About the Author

I'm David O’Neal, a cybersecurity professional specializing in Governance, Risk, and Compliance with 3+ years of experience spanning vulnerability management, audit readiness, IAM, and risk analysis.

- **Security Consulting**: Delivered vulnerability remediation strategies and audit support for aerospace and industrial clients.
- **Governance & Risk**: Built risk registers, performed compliance gap analyses, and developed security policies mapped to NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001.
- **Hands-On Technical Work**: Implemented IAM controls, optimized patching workflows, and improved remediation timelines from weeks to under 72 hours.
- **Focus Areas**: Cloud security foundations (AWS), risk management frameworks, and vendor risk assessment.

My professional focus is turning complex compliance frameworks into actionable security improvements that reduce risk and satisfy auditors—without slowing down the business.

## What's Inside

- **Portfolio Templates**: Customized templates for showcasing my GRC projects.
- **Hands-on Labs**: Step-by-step labs I’ve completed in AWS security and compliance.
- **Case Studies**: Written breakdowns of simulated risk assessments, vendor risk reviews, and compliance gap analyses.
- **Learning Resources**: Notes and curated references that support each project.

## Repository Structure

This repository is part of a progressive release strategy for my upcoming book [GRC Engineering: Building Secure, Compliant AWS Environments](https://grcengineeringbook.com/). Currently, it includes:

```
GRC_Portfolio/
├── README.md - You are here!
├── CONTRIBUTING.md - Guidelines for contributors
├── LICENSE - Project license
├── portfolio-templates/ - Templates and examples for your GRC portfolio
├── labs/ - Hands-on AWS security labs with full code and documentation
│   └── lab-1-account-governance/ - AWS account security foundations 
├── resources/ - AWS security services guide
└── config/ - Configuration files for testing and development
```

**Coming Soon:** Additional labs will be released weekly, leading up to the book launch. Each new lab will introduce additional AWS security domains and challenges. Stay tuned for:

- IAM Implementation
- Security Automation with IaC
- Security Monitoring and Incident Response
- Compliance Automation
- Data Security and Protection
- Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling
- Infrastructure and Network Protection
- Incident Response and Recovery
- Policy as Code implementation
- Advanced multi-lab integration challenges and capstone projects

## Labs Overview

Currently included:

1. **AWS Account Governance and Security Foundations** – Implemented IAM Identity Center (SSO), MFA enforcement, AWS Config rules, Security Hub, and cost controls aligned with CIS benchmarks.
2. **Enterprise Risk Assessment (Simulated)** – Created a risk register, scored risks (likelihood × impact), mapped controls, and proposed treatments with measurable KPIs.

Planned additions:
- Compliance gap analysis (ISO 27001 vs NIST 800-53 baseline)
- Vendor risk assessment framework
- Business continuity and incident response planning

## Future Labs (Coming Weekly)

Following our progressive release strategy, we'll be introducing new labs regularly, covering:

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Implementation of least privilege access controls
- **Security Automation with Infrastructure as Code**: Implementing security guardrails through IaC
- **Security Monitoring and Incident Response**: Setting up effective monitoring systems
- **Compliance Automation**: Streamlining regulatory compliance
- **Data Security and Protection**: Ensuring data confidentiality and integrity
- **Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling**: Methodologies for AWS environments
- **Infrastructure and Network Protection**: Securing AWS networking components
- **Incident Response and Recovery**: Creating effective incident handling procedures
- **Policy as Code**: Implementation of scalable policy management via CI/CD
- **Advanced Capstone Projects**: End-to-end implementations that combine concepts from multiple domains

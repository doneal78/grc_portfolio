## Disclaimers

1. This is a personal project and does not represent or reflect the views, opinions, or work of my past employers.  
2. The code, configurations, and resources in this repository are for **educational purposes only**. They demonstrate security and GRC concepts and should not be used directly in production without proper review, testing, and customization.

## Project Vision

This GRC Portfolio Hub is my personal initiative to showcase practical Governance, Risk, and Compliance work. It blends technical security practices with GRC frameworks, demonstrating how risk management and compliance can be applied in a way that supports business operations and security outcomes.

The portfolio is designed to:
- Highlight hands-on AWS security and compliance labs I’ve completed.  
- Provide case studies that walk through risk assessments, vendor risk reviews, and compliance gap analyses.  
- Serve as a professional portfolio to share with hiring managers and peers.

## About the Author

I'm **David O’Neal**, a cybersecurity professional with 3+ years of experience in Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC), vulnerability management, audit readiness, and IAM.

- **Security Consulting**: Delivered vulnerability remediation strategies and audit support for aerospace and industrial clients.  
- **Governance & Risk**: Built risk registers, performed compliance gap analyses, and developed security policies mapped to NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001.  
- **Hands-On Security**: Improved remediation timelines from weeks to under 72 hours across hundreds of findings by streamlining patch management and IAM processes.  
- **Focus Areas**: AWS security foundations, risk management frameworks (NIST, ISO), vendor risk, and compliance automation.  

I’m passionate about bridging the gap between technical controls and business risk, creating audit-ready solutions that improve security without slowing down the organization.

## Labs & Projects

### Completed
1. **AWS Account Governance and Security Foundations**  
   - Implemented IAM Identity Center (SSO), MFA enforcement, AWS Config rules, and centralized monitoring via Security Hub.  
   - Mapped controls to NIST CSF and CIS benchmarks.  
   - Outcome: Established a baseline governance model with audit-ready evidence.  

2. **Enterprise Risk Assessment (Simulated)**  
   - Conducted a full 3–6 month risk management cycle (risk appetite interviews, risk identification, scoring, treatment planning).  
   - Built a risk register and heat map aligned with NIST 800-53 and FAIR-lite analysis.  
   - Outcome: Prioritized top 10 risks and built a remediation roadmap.  

### Coming Soon
- **Compliance Gap Analysis**: Comparing ISO 27001 vs. NIST 800-53 control sets.  
- **Vendor Risk Management**: Vendor risk scoring, security questionnaires, and monitoring playbooks.  
- **Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery**: Plans, tabletop exercises, and metrics.

## Repository Structure

This repository is part of a progressive release strategy for my upcoming book [GRC Engineering: Building Secure, Compliant AWS Environments](https://grcengineeringbook.com/). Currently, it includes:

```
GRC_Portfolio/
├── README.md - You are here!
├── portfolio-templates/ - Templates and examples for portfolio pages
├── projects/ - Project case studies and artifacts
│ ├── aws-account-governance.md
│ └── risk-assessment.md
├── labs/ - Hands-on AWS security labs with full code and documentation
├── resources/ - AWS/GRC resources and learning references
└── config/ - Configuration files for testing and development
```

**Coming Soon:** Additional labs will be released weekly, leading up to the book launch. Each new lab will introduce additional AWS security domains and challenges. Stay tuned for:

- IAM Implementation
- Security Automation with IaC
- Security Monitoring and Incident Response
- Compliance Automation
- Data Security and Protection
- Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling
- Infrastructure and Network Protection
- Incident Response and Recovery
- Policy as Code implementation
- Advanced multi-lab integration challenges and capstone projects

## Labs Overview

Currently included:

1. **AWS Account Governance and Security Foundations** – Implemented IAM Identity Center (SSO), MFA enforcement, AWS Config rules, Security Hub, and cost controls aligned with CIS benchmarks.
2. **Enterprise Risk Assessment (Simulated)** – Created a risk register, scored risks (likelihood × impact), mapped controls, and proposed treatments with measurable KPIs.

Planned additions:
- Compliance gap analysis (ISO 27001 vs NIST 800-53 baseline)
- Vendor risk assessment framework
- Business continuity and incident response planning

## Future Labs (Coming Weekly)

Following our progressive release strategy, we'll be introducing new labs regularly, covering:

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Implementation of least privilege access controls
- **Security Automation with Infrastructure as Code**: Implementing security guardrails through IaC
- **Security Monitoring and Incident Response**: Setting up effective monitoring systems
- **Compliance Automation**: Streamlining regulatory compliance
- **Data Security and Protection**: Ensuring data confidentiality and integrity
- **Risk Assessment and Threat Modeling**: Methodologies for AWS environments
- **Infrastructure and Network Protection**: Securing AWS networking components
- **Incident Response and Recovery**: Creating effective incident handling procedures
- **Policy as Code**: Implementation of scalable policy management via CI/CD
- **Advanced Capstone Projects**: End-to-end implementations that combine concepts from multiple domains

# Risk Assessment (Simulated)

**Objective**: Demonstrate structured risk analysis using FAIR-lite scoring with a simulated dataset.

---

### Problem
Many organizations track risks but struggle to:
- Prioritize effectively  
- Quantify business impact  
- Translate findings into treatment plans  

---

### Approach
1. **Risk Register**: Built sample register with 10 simulated risks.  
2. **FAIR-Lite Scoring**: Applied qualitative impact × likelihood → heatmap.  
3. **Treatment Plan**: Chose mitigation, acceptance, or transfer per risk.  
4. **Evidence**: Documented in Markdown, with artifacts like control mappings and sample tickets.  

---

### Outcome
- Delivered a register showing **clear prioritization** of high-impact risks.  
- Demonstrated a repeatable framework that can scale across business units.  
- Showed how governance and risk tie directly into **business objectives**.

### Evidence Artifacts
- 📊 Risk register table (Markdown)  
- 🗂️ FAIR-lite scoring worksheet  
- 📝 Treatment plan for top 3 risks

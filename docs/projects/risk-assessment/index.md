# Risk Assessment — Simulated

This project demonstrates how to conduct a simulated enterprise risk assessment and create an actionable risk register.  
The goal is to show end-to-end methodology from identifying risks to recommending treatments, aligned with industry frameworks.

## Objectives
- Identify and score security risks across a fictional environment.
- Apply likelihood × impact methodology with FAIR-lite scoring.
- Build a risk register that management can actually use.
- Recommend treatment options with clear ownership.

## Methodology
1. **Risk Identification**  
   - Interview key stakeholders.  
   - Collect input from security events, vulnerability scans, and business processes.

2. **Scoring & Prioritization**  
   - Use likelihood × impact matrix.  
   - Apply FAIR-lite methodology for quantification.

3. **Risk Register**  
   - Document each risk with owner, impact, likelihood, score, and treatment plan.  
   - Create in spreadsheet format for clarity and repeatability.

4. **Treatment Planning**  
   - Recommend mitigation, transfer, acceptance, or avoidance.  
   - Assign remediation actions and timelines.

## Evidence / Artifacts
- **Risk Register (Excel/CSV)** — sample with 10–15 risks.
- **Scoring Matrix** — likelihood vs. impact heat map.
- **Sample Treatment Plans** — written remediations tied to controls.

## Framework Mapping
- **NIST CSF**: ID.RA, PR.IP, RS.MI  
- **ISO 27001**: A.6.1 (risk management), A.18.2 (review of controls)

## Lessons Learned
- Standardized scoring reduces bias and debate.  
- Visual heat maps help executives grasp relative risk quickly.  
- Linking risks to frameworks makes audit conversations smoother.

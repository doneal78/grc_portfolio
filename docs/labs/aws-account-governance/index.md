# Risk Assessment (Simulated)

**Objective**: Demonstrate structured risk analysis using FAIR‑lite scoring with a simulated dataset.

## Problem
Organizations track risks but struggle to:
- Prioritize effectively  
- Quantify business impact  
- Translate findings into treatment plans  

## Approach
1. **Risk Register** — 10 simulated risks with owners and controls.  
2. **FAIR‑Lite Scoring** — qualitative impact × likelihood → heatmap.  
3. **Treatment Plan** — mitigation, acceptance, or transfer by risk.  
4. **Evidence** — Markdown artifacts: control mappings, sample tickets.

## Outcome
- Clear prioritization of high‑impact risks  
- Repeatable framework that scales across business units  
- Governance and risk tied directly to **business objectives**

## Evidence Artifacts
- Risk register table (Markdown)  
- FAIR‑lite scoring worksheet  
- Treatment plan for top 3 risks
